<h1 id="why-english"><a name="why-english" href="#why-english"></a>Why English</h1>
<p>Firstly, I don’t care about how terrible my english is, I know it's so many mistakes of grammar and a lot of wrong words in my sentence but, you should know that I can make you understand what am I talking about, That’s Fucking Enough!</p>
<p>Both of english and chinese are beautiful human languages, I don’t partial to any of them, but sometimes I would love to write in english and speak in english, here is some reasons.</p>
•When I don’t like a superficial chinese guy.<br/>
•When I think the word is “baby could”<br/>
<p>Eh, That's it.<br>And scondly, I don’t care to explain to a superficial chinese guy why I write in english. But I still write it down! why? coz I konw they will use baidu or xx translator. But that is ineffective coz my english is terrible hahhhhhhh…X)</p>
