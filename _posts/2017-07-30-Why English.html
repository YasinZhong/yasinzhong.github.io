<h1 id="why-english"><a name="why-english" href="#why-english"></a>Why English</h1>
<p>Firstly, I don’t care about how terrible my english is, I know that so many mistakes of grammar in my sentence  and here is a lot of wrong words but, you should know that I can make you understand what am I talking, That’s fucking enough.</p>
<p>Both of english and chinese are beautiful human languages, I don’t partial to any of them, but sometimes I love to write in english and speak in english, here is some reasons.</p>
<ul>
<li>When I don’t like a superficial chinese guy.</li><li>When I think the word is “baby could”</li></ul>
<p>Eh, just it.<br>And scondly, I don’t care to explain to a superficial chinese guy why I write in english.<br>But I still write it down, why? coz I konw they will use baidu or xx translator. But that is ineffective coz my english is terrible hahhhhhhh…X)</p>
