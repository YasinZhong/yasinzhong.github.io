<h2>极简主义-My Minimalism</h2>
<p>
  在我高中的时候， 非常的精力旺盛。<br/>
  什么东西都想学一学，对所有东西都充满好奇和热情。
  我那时设计的网站和功能，非常的繁复，实现起来，难度也很大<br/>
  以至于不少功能以我的水平根本实现不了。<br/>
  现在觉得有点累了。<br/>
  "极简" 其实也是很漂亮的。

    When I was a high schoolers,I was very energetic and curious in everything.<br/>
    The website I design at that time is much too complex to work out. ... ...<br/>
    No one work with me and I refuse the help of my friend and other,it seems foolish. However,I got a little bit tired now.<br/>
    The Minimalism, is graceful too,I think.<br/>
